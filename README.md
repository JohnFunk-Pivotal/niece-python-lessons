# niece-python-lessons
This repo contains a bunch of lesson to help my nieces learn Python

## Tools used:
For these lessons we will rely on core material from the following online classes:
* [Udemy Complete Pything Programming Course]( https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-programming-course-beginner-to-advanced/learn/v4/overview) I like this one because it starts people out using Jupyter notebook
* [Packt Beginning Python Video](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-python-video) This one is more programmer centric
